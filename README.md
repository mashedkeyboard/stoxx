# StoXX - The stock management system for the masses #

Python and stuff. This was created as a high school project, so it's a bit messy. Bear with it!

### Is this thing on? ###

* Yes.

### How does it work? ###

* Client-server implementation
* Uses the Stock Control Messaging Protocol, or SCMP - a protocol created for StoXX that operates in a similar manner to SMTP
* Is fantastic
* Uses Python 3
* Designed and developed for Windows and Windows Embedded systems - perfect for a stock control scenario - although Linux should work too
* Is fantastic
